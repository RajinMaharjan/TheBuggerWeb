### Install pnpm globally so you can use it in any project
```sh
npm install -g pnpm 
```
### Clone The repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RajinMaharjan/TheBuggerWeb.git
```
#### Open the Terminal in the cloned location then run:
#### Install the dependencies and node modules of the project 
```sh
pnpm install 
```
#### Run the Project
```sh
pnpm dev  
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
